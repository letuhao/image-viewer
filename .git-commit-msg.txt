fix: Sidebar pagination now uses relative navigation (Option 2)

ISSUE: Page 2 jumped to absolute position (ranks 20-39) instead of next items after page 1

PROBLEM WITH HYBRID APPROACH:
  Page 1: Ranks 24,329-24,349 (centered on 24,339)
  Page 2: Ranks 20-39 (absolute from start) <- WRONG!
  
  User expected: Next 20 items after page 1's range

SOLUTION: Relative pagination from current position

NEW ALGORITHM:

Page 1: Centered on current (with smart edge handling)
  currentPosition = 24,339
  Start: 24,339 - 10 = 24,329
  End: 24,339 + 10 = 24,349
  Result: Ranks 24,329-24,349 (21 items)

Page 2: Next window after page 1
  centeredStart = 24,329
  centeredSize = 21
  itemsToSkip = 21 + (0 * 20) = 21
  Start: 24,329 + 21 = 24,350
  End: 24,350 + 19 = 24,369
  Result: Ranks 24,350-24,369 (20 items)

Page 3: Next window after page 2
  itemsToSkip = 21 + (1 * 20) = 41
  Start: 24,329 + 41 = 24,370
  End: 24,370 + 19 = 24,389
  Result: Ranks 24,370-24,389 (20 items)

BENEFITS:
- Intuitive: Next = forward, Previous = backward
- Context preserved: Page 1 always shows current
- No confusion: No jumping to absolute positions
- Better UX: Shows context around current collection

STATUS: Relative pagination working correctly!
