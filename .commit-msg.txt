feat: Image Viewer pagination - Load images progressively

PHASE 4 COMPLETE: Image Viewer Pagination

PROBLEM:
- Hardcoded limit: 1000 images
- Collections with 10k+ images fail or very slow
- All images loaded at once (poor performance)

SOLUTION: Progressive pagination with auto-loading

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Dynamic Page Size
   - Read imageViewerPageSize from backend settings (default: 200)
   - Replaces hardcoded limit: 1000

2. Paginated Loading State
   - currentPage: tracks which page to load
   - allLoadedImages: accumulates loaded images
   - totalImagesCount: total images in collection
   - useImages with page and limit parameters

3. Image Accumulation
   - useEffect merges new page data into allLoadedImages
   - Deduplicates by image ID
   - Preserves order

4. Auto-Loading Near Edges
   - Threshold: 20 images from end
   - Auto-loads next page when user navigates near end
   - Seamless experience (no manual "load more" button)

5. Collection Reset
   - Resets allLoadedImages when collection changes
   - Resets to page 1

6. goToLast Support
   - Calculates which page contains last image
   - Loads that page first
   - Navigates to last image once loaded

7. UI Indicator
   - Shows: "X of Y (Loaded: Z)" when paginated
   - Example: "150 of 10,000 (Loaded: 400)"
   - Clear indication of pagination status

BENEFITS:
✅ Fast initial load (200 images vs 1000)
✅ Supports collections of any size (100k+ images)
✅ Seamless auto-loading
✅ Memory efficient
✅ User-configurable pageSize
✅ Works with all modes (single, double, slideshow)

EXAMPLES:

Collection with 10,000 images, pageSize=200:
  Initial: Loads page 1 (images 1-200)
  Navigate to image 180: Near end, auto-load page 2 (201-400)
  Navigate to image 380: Auto-load page 3 (401-600)
  Total loaded: 600 images (vs 1000 before, or 10k without pagination)

goToLast with 10,000 images:
  Calculate lastPage = ceil(10000 / 200) = 50
  Load page 50 (images 9,801-10,000)
  Navigate to image 10,000
  Only 200 images loaded!

STATUS: Image Viewer pagination complete!
